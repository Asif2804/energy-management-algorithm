### Energy Management Algorithm

This project implements an energy optimization system using a Raspberry Pi and historical electricity pricing data retrieved from the Octopus Energy API. The system simulates energy usage scheduling based on variable time-of-use tariffs and controls a custom electronics demo via GPIO pins. Logged data is exported to Excel for analysis and cost evaluation.

## Key Features
- Retrieves historical pricing data from the Octopus Energy API
- Simulates time-based energy scheduling to reduce cost
- Uses Raspberry Pi to control custom hardware via GPIO
- Logs energy usage and cost data to CSV
- Performs cost analysis using Excel

## Technologies & Tools
- Python (API data parsing, control logic, CSV logging)
- Raspberry Pi (GPIO control for hardware demo)
- Octopus Energy API (historical tariff data)
- Excel (data analysis and visualization)
- Custom electronics hardware

## Project Outcomes
- Demonstrated potential for 10â€“15% energy cost savings using historical pricing patterns
- Integrated data-driven control logic with physical hardware
- Practiced API usage, embedded control, and post-simulation analysis
